          <h3>Humanities and Interpretation</h3>
          <div style="text-align:left">
          <p>The humanities tend to rely heavily on an
          <em>interpretive</em>. That is we interpret texts (or social
          phenomena understood as texts) in order to *understand*
          them. This is different from the [social] sciences, which seek
          to uncover *evidence* of phenomena which are often presumed to
          not need interpretation, to speak for themselves. This
          evidence is data (whether it is derived by quantitative or
          qualitative methods.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>con't</h3>
          <div style="text-align:left">
          <p>The humanities can take advantage of positive
          evidence/data/quantitative/qualitative methods, but its
          primary methodology remains interpretation.</p>
          <p>The idea that the humanities can be studied without
          interpretation, using the same methodologies as the sciencies,
          is called <em>naturalism</em>.</p>
          <p>Another term you might hear which means the same as
          interpretation is <em>hermeneutics</em>, derived from the
          Greek "hermÄ“neuein", meaning "to interpret".</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            Two things important to remember: the circle refers to parts
            and whole (e.g. a specific element of a text to the entirety
            of the text) and to text and context (e.g. a particular text
            in its social, historical, political, and economic context).

          <h3>The Research Life Cycle</h3>
          <img src="img/dsr-graphic.png" height="500" />
          <aside class="notes">

            Plan: this is pretty straightforward, and most of you will
            already have begun it. However, there's no neat division
            between the planning and acquisition phase, as there might
            be in, say, natural scientific experimental or observational research.

            These steps are often defined in terms of positivist, even
            quantitative research methods. For example, the second step
            (acquire) is sometimes called "create", because the
            assumption is that the researcher is creating data out of
            observations or some other means. For humanities
            researchers, our research data often already exists, in the
            form of texts or other cultural artefacts. We don't "create"
            that data, and often we don't even think of those things as
            "research data".

            Similarly, the "process" step is often where we would place
            interpretation and understanding, which is a less rigorously
            defined and straightforward activity than "data processing".
            The "process" step is where we would find the hermeneutic
            circle. It is also not easy (and sometimes impossible) to
            neatly distinguish between the process and the analyze
            phases: interpretation and understanding involve working
            through and analyzing our texts in an iterative fashion.

            Preservation is straightforward: publication and deposit in
            either a library's digital repository or a disciplinary
            repository.

            Share results. This is another area where the priority given
            to the sciences can be confusing for humanities researchers.
            Humanities research doesn't produce "results", it produces
            new understanding and (probably) a text that explains that
            understanding. These aren't "results" in a scientific sense.
            Results for scientists are evidence that can be re-used in
            further studies; in the humanities, our understanding
            is not re-used in the same way: it becomes additional
            context for future interpretations (by us or by others).

            Discover and re-use. Fairly straightforward as long as we
            bear the caveats around re-use in mind. Discovery is enabled
            by publication and deposit on an institutional or
            disciplinary platform.

          <h3>Research Data Management></h3>
          <p>Similar problems arise when we look into Research Data
          Management policies, such as those mandated by the Tri-Council
          (e.g. SSHRC). Research data is often understood in social or
          natural scientific terms rather than humanities terms. For
          example, on the <a
                              href="https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/funding-financement/nfrf-fnfr/transformation/research_data_management-gestion_des_donnees_de_recherche-eng.aspx">SSHRC
                              RDM page</a>, research data is described
                            as:
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <ul><li>used as primary sources to support technical or
              scientific enquiry, research, scholarship, or artistic
              activity;</li>
            <li>used as evidence in the research process; and/or</li>
              <li>commonly accepted in the research community as necessary to validate research findings and results.
              </li></ul>
              <aside class="notes">
                These descriptions don't really fit in a humanities
                context. For example, a primary source for a historian isn't really
                "research data", nor are Ukrainian churches on the
                prairie, or historical concepts of nationhood.

              Also, research data sharing in the sciences is primarily
              about verifying methodological soundness and replication,
              neither of which apply in the humanities. Interpretation
              is not reproducible because the interpreter is a human
              being with their own history, background, identity, etc.
              Research data alone is insufficient to reproduce an
              interpretation. Similarly, you can't really evaluate an
              interpretive methodology. A given interpretation can only
              be evaluated by reading and understanding it, as it is
              embodied in a written (or another kind of) text.

              Where Research Data Management does become important is
              when humanities researchers use social science (quant or
              qual) methodologies, such as surveys, focus groups, etc.
              In this case, primary data <em>is</em> being produced by
              the researcher, and that data does have to be managed,
              preserved, and (ideally) shared. This of course raises
              questions of privacy and other research ethics, which are
              not normally a consideration for text-based humanities
              research.</aside>
